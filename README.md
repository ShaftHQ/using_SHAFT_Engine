## I. Quick Start Guide üèÉ
### Step 1: Setting up your project
- Click the blue button above that says "Use this template" > "Create a new repository"
- From your new repository click the blue button that says "<> Code" > "Open with GitHub Desktop"
- From your GitHub Desktop click the button that says "Open in JetBrains IntelliJ Idea Community Edition"
- With the latest SHAFT_Engine version, the engine will be able to configure itself in TestNG or JUnit mode automatically. You will not need to add any listeners anymore.
- If you're using Cucumber, due to a known issue with IntelliJ you need to edit your run configuration templates before running your feature files by following these steps:
  - Open 'Edit Run/Debug Configurations' dialog > Edit Configurations... > Edit configuration templates...
  - Select <b>Cucumber Java</b> > Program Arguments > and add this argument:
  <br/>`--plugin --plugin com.shaft.listeners.CucumberFeatureListener`
  - After saving the changes, remember to delete any old runs you may have triggered by mistake before adding the needed config.

### Step 2: Running some Tests
- Navigate to the module that you want to play with. For example ```GUI_Web```
- Navigate to any test class. For example ```src/test/java/TestPackage/TestClass.java```
- Press the green play button next to the class name to run the entire class, or next to a test method to run only that method.
- Test execution will begin, and you'll see the browser opening and the test running.
- The Test execution report will open automatically in your default web browser after the test run is completed.

## II. What's next?
### Configuration and User Guide
- Change the target browser, operating system, timeouts, and other configurations using the ‚öôÔ∏è [Configuration Manager](https://ShaftHQ.github.io/SHAFT_ENGINE/).
- Learn more about using SHAFT_Engine from the üë§ [User Guide](https://ShaftHQ.github.io/SHAFT_Engine_Docusaurus/) and üìö [Javadocs](https://ShaftHQ.github.io/SHAFT_ENGINE/apidocs/index.html).
- <b>Join</b> our ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/shafthq/shaft_engine?logoColor=black&style=social) to get notified by email when a new release is pushed out.
- After upgrading your Engine it is sometimes recommended to delete the properties folder ```src\main\resources\properties``` and allow SHAFT to regenerate the defaults by running any test method.

### CI/CD & DevOps
- This template comes preloaded with some Selenium grid 4 powered CI/CD pipelines to get you started!
- Navigate to "Actions" and then select "Desktop Browser Tests" from the side menu
- Click "Run workflow" and confirm your choice.
- You will notice that the pipeline has started building, and you can download the execution reports once the execution is completed.
